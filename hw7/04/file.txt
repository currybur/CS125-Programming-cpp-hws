    There are four people in my family, my parents, my sister and I. My father is very strict to us.
    When we make mistakes, he educates us. But my mother is very gentle. When my father is angry, she always consoles my sister and I then says good words about my father. Though sometimes we have arguments, the family atmosphere is very harmonious. For parents, one must play the strict role while the other plays the gentle role. My parents educate us in the classic way.
    My sister and I have grown up, and we are from naughty girls to responsible adults. Now we are brave and polite. When people speak highly of us, my parents will be very happy, because it owes to their education. I am lucky to born in a harmonious family.
